- Option to sort cards by name or interestingness
- Card images? As a kind of header or as the background or off to the side?
- Less than four columns at narrow widths
- Prices
- Ability to say what formats you do and do not care about
- Penny Dreadful as a format (using pd rank?)
- Default to a set of formats that make sense (no Peasant, Duel Commander, etc.)?
- Improve the overall score display so that it has a credit score colored arc
- Recalculate playability with the full (year's) data
- CubeCobra
- "Normal" EDH using edhrec rank
- Suppress Duel Commander, Canadian Highlander, Highlander and maybe others by default?
- Configurable "formats I care about"
- cron to keep db (and playability, and card names) up to date
- CI/CD in github
- When you click through to mtgtop8 then click the back button all state is lost (user_storage?)
- When you paste a large list (~900 items) nothing happens and there is no error message
- Apply black on save
- There's got to be a better way to organize web.py so it isn't indented to nine levels!
- Some system for keeping CubeCobra up to date (we just have a one time dump)
- Account for bannings that have happened in the last year (Fury is NOT useful in Modern!)
- Scryfall search for cards?
- When you click on the paste list tab, focus in the textarea
- /event?e=37372 is a 500 from mtgtop8 but we try and process it and the scraper breaks
